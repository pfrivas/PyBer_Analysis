# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
Conduct an exploratory analysis on data for very large CSV files. The exploratory analysis includes several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. The visualizations are made using python scripts using Panda's libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and MatPlotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations provided will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Resources
**Resources:** All data used in this analysis is found inside of the Resources folder.

**Software:** Python 3.11, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

**Language:** Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

**Code:** PyBer Challenge

Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.

Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
- The total number of rides for each city type.
- The average fares for each city type.
- The total number of drivers for each city type.

Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
- The number of rides for each city type.
- The fares for each city type.
- The number of drivers for each city type.

Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
- The percent of total fares.
- The percent of total rides.
- The percent of total drivers.
